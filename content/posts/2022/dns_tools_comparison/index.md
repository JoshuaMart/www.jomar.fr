## The Story

Hi everyone,
I recently came across this tweet which immediately intrigued me because I also observed that I was losing valid domains with PureDNS.

{{< img src="tweet.png" align="center" title="Tweet DNS Tools">}}

I had done some tests (not very thorough) 8 months ago on different tools and I had concluded at that time that PureDNS was the best solution. However, since then the tools have received various improvements and the main reason that pushed me to redo this test is that Amass has completely revised its DNS resolution and as it is one of my favorite tools I had to test that.

This filtering step seems to me particularly important because currently many hunters use the same tools and therefore obtain the same results.
So I prefer to concentrate on the processing of these results (which is underestimated in my opinion) in order to improve my recon and for that I need the cleanest possible base result.

_Note : This is obviously a personal opinion because others, like Corben Leo which has nothing to prove has a completely different methodology ([see here](https://twitter.com/hacker_/status/1517907518604861440)) which works great for him._

But for me it's too much time consuming, I try to have a good balance between time / costs / quality of results

## The test

For this test I used the following tools:
* [HTTPX](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx) v1.2.1
* [Amass](https://github.com/OWASP/Amass) v3.19.2
* [DNSX](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/dnsx) v1.1.0
* [PureDNS](https://github.com/d3mondev/puredns) v2.0.1

All installed on the same base namely a VPS with Ubuntu 22.04. For the tests I used the following protocol:

{{< img src="protocol.png" align="center" title="DNS Tools Protocol">}}

Which can be translated into:
  * Server 1 takes care of the passive collection of subdomains via Amass
    * On this same server I launch HTTPX directly on the results to have the subdomains reachable
  * On server 2 I use DNSX then HTTPX
  * On server 3 I use PureDNS then HTTPX
  * On server 4 I use directly Amass with its own resolution and I also use HTTPX at the end

I also used the same resolver list for all tools : [Proabiarl - Fresh Resolvers](https://github.com/proabiral/Fresh-Resolvers/blob/master/resolvers.txt)

The harvesting step is not really important here, it is far from being exhaustive because the only API key I used in Amass is the one from SecurityTrails, the important thing was only to have exactly the same base between all tools.

I also used different servers each time for the simple reason that if you run several DNS resolutions on a large number of invalid domains, you will get less and less results.

For this test I used the following domains:
  * uber.com
  * ford.com
  * sony.com
  * lazada.com
  * facebook.com

## Personal conclusion on the results

Before you read the results, I wanted to share my personal opinion on these results.

Firstly it would certainly have to be more thorough / exhaustive via port scanning and/or using HTTPX on many more ports to increase the false positive detection attempt. But I figured that wouldn't really change the result, I wanted to have an overall idea of which tool to use in my case.

* **Amass** with DNS resolution is the tool that seems to offer the best results, moreover it offers additional information that can be interesting (such as the target IP) for post-processing as well as a JSON output. However this one is extremely slow ... for Facebook the scan lasted 25 hours !
* **DNSX** seems to be the tool with the most false positives but it is fast and like Amass it offers additional domain information and JSON output
* **PureDNS** is also fast and seems to offer good results (not as good as Amass but better than DNSX), however it does not offer additional information or JSON output. Something to take into account here as well is that the tool doesn't seem to receive any updates at the moment compared to the other two :'(

So there is no right or wrong choice here I think, just a choice that must fit your pipeline and methodology.
